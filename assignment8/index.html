			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					To use this calculator app, you can guide your cursor with a mouse to press the various buttons on and around the calculator. The site starts in 
					5-button mode, where upon pressing "a", "w", "s," or "d", you enter the ability to switch and press buttons with those 4 directional keys, and "e",
					the key that will press the currently selected button. There is a button below the usual calculator buttons that allows the user to switch between this
					initial 5-button mode and a 3-button mode, where only "s" and "d" are the directional keys, and "e" remains the pressing key. The "d" key moves to the
					right, wrapping to the next row down when the farthest right spot is reached in the current row. The "a" key moves to the left, wrapping to the farthest
					right in the next row up when the leftmost button is reached. The "w" key moves upward, wrapping to the bottommost button in the same column once the topmost
					button is reached. The "s" key moves downward, wrapping to the topmost button in the same column once the bottommost button is reached.
				</li>
				<li>
					To determine which mode is "better", the time it took to press the buttons and the number of erroneous buttons pressed was measured. For both the
					5-button mode and the 3-button mode, the test started in the upper right-hand corner on the 7, and after every successful equation entered, the number field 
					had to be cleared with the button. The equations were "25 + 19 - 31 + 54 = 67", "20 * 4 + 16 - 7 = 89", "15 / 3 * 4 + 10 = 30", "40 * 2 - 15 / 5 = 13", and
					"51 / 3 + 24 * 2 = 82", with all the results based on the order in which the numbers and operations are entered from left to right. Erroneous buttons pressed, in
					this case, is all the buttons pressed that are not the 3 or 5 primary keys of the switch mode.
				</li>
				<li>
					The results from the five test runs conducted in each mode showed that the 5-button mode was faster, with an average time of 1 minute and 26 seconds, versus
					the 3-button mode's average of 3 minutes and 31 seconds. The 5-button mode was also less erroneous, with an average of 0 errors per test, as opposed to the
					3-button mode's average of 2.4 errors per test. The errors being greater than zero for the 3-button tests may have been due to the familiarity with the 5-button
					mode. Also, while the 5-button mode is faster, the 3-button mode has less buttons to press, and thus less requirement of movement of the hand or other appendage(s)
					to press the buttons.
