                    The clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic served faithfully with their Jedi generals in the Clone Wars, 
                    the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They fought battle after 
                    battle alongside the Jedi, counting loss after loss with each victory or defeat. By the end, they were as weary of
                    war as the rest of the galaxy was. However, it's unlikely they were expecting the war to end the way it did. They
                    were good soldiers, just following orders; but were those orders the right call?
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px">
                    Unbeknownst to the clones, they were precisely built to perform two functions: fight a war fabricated to distract the
                    galaxy, and carry out the revenge of the Sith against the Jedi. They were created to betray their comrades, who they 
                    fought with for the four long years of the war. They came heartwrenchingly close to revealing the truth, but arrogance 
                    and ignorance conspired to seal the fate of the clones and the Jedi Order. When the time came, they didn't need evidence 
                    to consign thousands of Jedi to death for treason, but would that have even mattered with their inhibitor chips in place?
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px">
                    Those inhibitor chips were the failsafe to prevent the clones from not following orders. While the Kaminoans did not consider 
                    it possible for the clones to have personality that could defy their own programming, it is tragic to think that the clones were 
                    built to have no personality, to be unfeeling killing machines that carried out orders regardless of what they are. It seems that
                    for a time after the issuance of Order 66, the clones lost their individuality, becoming cold peacekeepers of the nascent Galactic
                    Empire. Those that were closest to the Jedi, however, as well as the political shift in opinion on the clones, quickly reminded them 
                    of who they were.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 25px">
                    To sum it all up, the tragedy of the clones is that they were built to be the "droids" of the Galactic Republic, to be unfeeling
                    killing machines to exact out Darth Sidious' plot to destroy the Jedi in vengeance of the Sith of yore and become the ruler of
                    the entire galaxy in the name of the Sith. Despite their programming, though, they each became their own person, even though, genetically,
                    they were the same person copied a million times over. They bonded with their Jedi comrades, even though they were forced to end most of 
                    them. And that, along with other things, would be the eventual downfall of Darth Sidious.
